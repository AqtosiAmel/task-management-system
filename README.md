## Deployment

This project is deployed using **InfinityFree** free hosting service with the source code maintained on **GitHub**.

### Deployment Steps:

1. Developed and tested the app locally.
2. Pushed the final code to GitHub repository.
3. Created a free hosting account on InfinityFree.
4. Uploaded project files to the `public_html` folder via InfinityFree’s file manager or FTP.
5. Configured DNS and domain settings (if using a custom domain).
6. Waited for up to 72 hours for DNS propagation for the site to become accessible.

### Important Note:

Because InfinityFree is a free hosting provider, DNS propagation may take up to 72 hours before the site becomes publicly accessible.

## Challenges & Resolutions

* **DNS Propagation Delay:** The website was not immediately accessible after deployment. Resolved by waiting for up to 72 hours for DNS propagation to complete.
* **Limited Environment Variable Support:** Managed configurations directly within the codebase due to hosting restrictions.
* **Manual File Upload:** Ensured reliable uploads by using FTP clients instead of relying solely on the file manager.
